              Dry fruits are a rich source of a lot of minerals, proteins and essential oils. Because of this reason, most of us are advised by our elders to munch on a handful of almonds soaked in water overnight. Just like dry fruits, honey is also a rich source of minerals and proteins. 
                They both are packed with antioxidants and good fats that keep your body fit and healthy
               </p><br>
               <p>
                Benefit of dry fruits with honey is that it helps in reducing bad cholesterol. Almonds and walnuts are rich in magnesium, potassium, dietary fibre and manganese that help in reducing cholesterol in your body. Further, the antioxidant properties of honey will boost the dry fruits’ ability to flush out bad cholesterol from your body.
                 Regular eating dry fruits coated with honey increases the HDL or good cholesterol.
